CONTEXT: 
You are provided a graph data stored as networkx in python. This graph contains family tree data. It is a directed graph that has the following information
 * Nodes: Each node in the graph is a family member. Every family member has a unique id within the graph.
 * Node Attributes: Every node has the following attributes which represent information about a family member
    - Id: Unique id for a family member
    - Name: Name of the family member
    - Nicknames: List of nicknames for the member
    - Date of birth: Date of birth represented as Year-month-date
